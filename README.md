* Founded April 18, 2013

* Founded by Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt

* Tenev and Bhatt are two Stanford University graduates who initially worked in New York building platforms for trade exchanges but upon realizing that brokerage fees and account minimums marginalized the less wealthy, they decided they wanted to use technology to allow everyday people to be able to participate in financial exchanges.

* In September of 2020, Robinhood raised $660 million through Series G Funding leading to a company valuation of $11.7 billion.


## Business Activities:

* Robinhood is specifically aiming to solve the problem of decreasing the gap between those who can and can not participate in financial markets.  The founders recognized that due to large brokerage fees and account minimums, there was a disparity in participation in the financial markets.  The wealthy had a greater advantage, so RobinHood was founded to lessen the gap and increase accessibility to trading in the financial markets.

* RobinHood's intended for both the wealthy and average income individuals.  However 80% of their market is the "Millenial" with and average age of 26 years old. 

* Robinhood utilizes a mobile app to allow users to trade stocks, funds, and cryptocurrencies without having to pay commissions.  In addition to their mobile app, they employ a website; both of which specifically incorporate the use of technologies such as Python, React, bootstrap, HTML5, and Google Analytics. 

## Landscape:

* RobinHood is a financial services company.

* The major trend within the financial services domain over the past 5-10 years is moving to a digital platform that increases accessibility.

* The top companies competing with Robinhood within this domain are: Etrade, Coinbase, River financial and Charles Schwab. 

## Results

* The primary business impact of Robinhood is that their retail investors are generating sufficient traffic to influence stocks and segments of the market.

* The core metric that companies in this domain use to measure success is Assets Under Management (AUM). RobinHood's 2020 AUM was estimated at $20 billion.

* As a newer company, Robinhood is performing well compared to other new companies such as River Financial with an AUM of %1.6 billion and Coinbase with an AUM of $20 billion.  However compared to its more established competitors Etrade with an AUM of $346 billion and Charles Schwab with an AUM of $3.25 trillion, there is still room for growth in order be considered competitive based on this metric.


## Recommendations

* If I were to advise the company I would suggest they offer more intuitive technology platforms by expanding the use of Robo-advising technology to include cryptocurrencies in order to broaden the education and investment in this segment of the market.

* I believe this would benefit the company because 80% of their market is the Millenial demographic.  This demographic is very tech savvy and relies heavily on technology to gain access and understanding of trends.  By utilizing robo-advisement, millenials will have cryptocurrency education and investment strategies at their fingertips.

* Robo advising can be expanded by utilizing AI technology to optimize advisement through machine learning.  This would allow Robinhood's app to not only advise clients based on criteria such as risk tolerance, financial goals, etc. But would also be able to include in that advisement potential tax implications and strategies for minimizing tax consequences.
